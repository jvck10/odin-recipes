# odin-recipes

Hello! My name is Vi Huynh and so far I am trying to learn web development through The Odin Project! The current project is going to be a basic website for recipes.

Reflection:
I have completed the assignment for creating a basic website for recipes. Through this assignment I learned to handle basic html functions and figure out ways to complete the required task. My typing of the necessary functions has improved, I can remember the basic start as well as remember the different ways to use the 'commands' within html.
